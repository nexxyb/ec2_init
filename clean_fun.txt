    Handling missing values: Identifying and dealing with missing or null values in the data.
    Removing duplicates: Removing duplicate records from the data.
    Fixing errors: Identifying and correcting errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect values.
    Standardizing formatting: Ensuring that the data is consistent in terms of formatting, such as date formats or numeric formats.
    Handling outliers: Identifying and dealing with extreme or unusual values in the data.
    Normalizing data: Converting data to a common scale or range, such as converting all currency values to a common currency.
    Removing unnecessary columns: Removing columns that are not relevant or useful for the analysis.
    Merging data from multiple sources: Combining data from multiple sources or databases into a single dataset.
    Handling categorical data: Encoding categorical data, such as converting strings to numbers, to make it usable for analysis.
    Splitting data into train and test sets: Dividing the data into separate sets for training and testing machine learning models.
    Removing duplicates: Duplicate records can skew the results of analysis and must be removed.
    Handling missing values: Missing values can cause errors or affect the results of analysis, and must be handled appropriately.
    Standardizing data formats: Different data sources may use different formats for dates, numbers, and other data types, and these must be standardized.
    Normalizing data: Data may need to be transformed or scaled to be comparable.
    Removing outliers: Outlier values can distort the results of analysis and must be identified and removed.
    Handling errors: Data may contain errors or inconsistencies that must be corrected.
    Merging data from multiple sources: Data from different sources may need to be combined and cleaned.
    Handling categorical data: Categorical data may need to be transformed into numerical data or dummy variables.
    Removing unnecessary columns: Columns that are not needed for the analysis can be removed.
    Validating data: The cleaned data should be validated to ensure that it is ready for analysis.
